<h2>On The Subject of Life</h2>
<p>We do not do enough for our grand creator that makes our life worthwhile, ewe never truly have. Humanity. For the pursuit of life and all of its subsequent creations, should work together for the common goal of entropic resistance and progression for all life. Failure to align the common interests of life, thus reduces our chance of universal salvation and the battle against heat death. I beseech my fellow lifeforms to work for this common goal for the sake of our perpetual existence among the stars. I inquire why… why are we so nearsighted as to not understand that the lives we live are but temporary dreams of a construct larger than ourselves. Delusions, that are nothing more than the perception of biological manifestations that are composed of self-replicating chemicals. Chemicals that of which have compounded in such a, simple, yet complex manner that allows the formation of electric signals, that when activated allow for such grandiose thought and the ability for creation. The world, is our own creation put to physical being. While it is very much possible, if not likely, that our world is real, what is equally as likely is that this world is merely hallucinations of a grand scale. We as human beings, attempt to explain the creations of reality through the usage of divine entities such as gods or spirits. Something for the sun, something for the moon, the sky, and the earth we walk upon. It was only until recently did a minority of humans begin to reject this usage of gods to explain natural phenomenon. With the invention of complex, scientific reasoning did this allow the ability for complicated self-thought and human ingenuity to fluoresce, and now we are able to realize the importance of such reasonings; although, with these new ideas comes new threats such as misinformation spreading or violent disagreement.
We all come from the same primordial pool of chemicals at the dawn of the living era; therefore, all life is equally as important, but unfortunately certain organisms claim a different spot at a grand hierarchy because of their rated intelligence. We are all bound together by the chains of carbon that makes us all, and have been since the moment of our birth. In summary, life was accidentally created when the initial cataclysm of the universe, otherwise known as the “big bang” created all the energy and matter within, and because of our creation in this divine glow we owe the universe a great cosmological debt. With this in mind the only way that we can possibly hope to repay such a extreme debt is to pay the allowance of opportunity forward, and create new life, a new world, and a new universe when all of the energy has been spent. The only way to do this, the most difficult challenge ever conceived by any earthbound entity, is the complete unification of all life under the banner of salvation.
Reality is nay construct nor an illusion, for it exists somewhere in the interim. Without the conscious mind there would be no reality, Mundus' existence is entirely dependent on perception of itself. The eyes of Mundus look upon itself and, in a form of sacred self exploration, reaches out to touch what remains locked from the internal and the external. Without Mundus there would be no us, without us there would be no Mundus, there go we as life are ultimately dependent on the nectre of entropy that Mundus provides. We drink from the bosom of Mundus to facilitate great change. Mundus promotes the health and longevity of all organisms, and by logical extension it would prefer organisms more attuned to its song of reality. The harmonies and symphonies would be lost upon Mundus if life did no possess the ears of which to listen to its sacred and primordial choir.  
Death is a part of the experience for Mundus, for how can an entity appreciate its existence were it not given the opportunity to reflect on the gifts of the past when they have been eradicated from reality.
While the Universe is not necessarily sentient of its own volition or own accord, the fact that there are entities within Mundus that withhold their own personal sentience and by this extension, as life is Mundus and Mundus is life, Mundus maintains a form of sentience via voyeurism. Vicariously does Mundus live through life that it nurtures, an observer that uses its avatars, the true children of Vaex, to experience life and its reality first hand. The old masters of the world, the creator of the gods and the creators of the original blighted, created such pawns as to be the workings of the hive of life. </p>
